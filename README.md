# Quantitative Finance Interview Questions and Strategies

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this writing is to provide a "in-a-nutshell" kind of summary on key topics frequently tested in quantitative interviews in finance.
The most relevant roles are quantitative researchers/developers/analysts, portfolio researcher/analysts, risk modeller/analysts etc.
More recently, we also saw tech-heavy data scientist/machine learning scientist interviews to start feature similar types of questions discussed here.

### Who are we
The lead contributors so far (we hope to see more contributors as this project evolves) typically have an advanced degree in a
quantitative field (some of them also spent time at top tech firms) and then made a successful transition into finance (top hedge funds and banks).

### Writing guidelines
We strive to make sure to only include content that are pertinent and deliver it in a concise, intuitive, and self-contained fashion.
We will focus on generalizable knowledge points, methods and problem solving strategies rather than exact questions.

## Calculus


## Linear algebra
- vector and matrix multiplication
- matrix operations (transpose, determinant, inverse etc)
- types of matrices (symmetric, hermition, orthogonal etc)
- eigenvalue and eigenvectors
- matrix calculus (gradients, hessian etc
- useful theorems



## Probability
Probability puzzles are reported to be the hardest and most unpredictable type of interview questions. This does not have to be the case for you.
Solving probability interview questions is really all about pattern recognition and then applying the correct tools/theorems.
Once you recognize the underlying mechanics of a problem it is usually no more than two or three quick steps away from the answer.
What this requires is a thorough and, more importantly, intuitive understanding of the key concepts, coupled with sufficient amount of practice to improve your patter recognition skills.

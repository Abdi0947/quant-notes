## Introduction: objective and scope

Pertinent, concise, intuitive, self-contained.


  
## Calculus and linear algebra



## Probability
### Combinatorics
- Permutation
- Combinations
- Inclusion-exclusion

### Conditional probability
- Bayes rule
- Law of total probability
Â 
### Probability Distributions
- Expectation and variance equations
- Discrete probability and stories
- Continuous probability: uniform, gaussian, poisson

### Expectations, variance, and covariance
- linearity of expectation
- law of total expectation
- covariance and correlation
- independence implies zero correlation
- hash collision probability

### Universality of Uniform distribution
- proof
- circle problem

### Order statistics
- expectation of min and max and random variable

### Graph-based solutions involving multiple random variables
breaking stick
meeting at the train station
simplex
frog jump

### Approximation trick1: Central limit theorem
- fake coin
- monte carlo integration

### Approximation trick2: Poisson paradigm
- birthday problem, birthday triplets, near birthday problem
- repeated draws

### Poisson count/time duality
- possion from possions

### Markov chain tricks
- various games
- introduction of martingale


## Statistics


## Programming essentials
The bare minimum of coding concept you need to know well.

Material on these topics are widely available elsewhere, so we will just cite them here.

Data structures:
array, dict, link list, tree, heap, graph, ways of representing sparse matrix

Sorting: brilliant.org

Tree/Graph related algorithms
traversal (BFS, DFS)
shortest path (two sided BFS, djikstra)

Recuision, iteration and DP:

## Numerical methods and optimization

## Machine learning concepts
